                My experience at Frontiers has greatly influenced my attitude and
                personality. I now have better communication skills, a better
                understanding of the rules governing academic work, and knowledge
                of a variety of skills, including poster design and management. I
                have also tried to give my all for the club and college in a
                variety of ways. I'm grateful that the club's founder, Kumar
                Gaurav sir, gave me the chance to be its leader.

                An amazing group of learners where seniors always show you the
                right path. This is a very good Club to do hobby related works
                other than the academics.
